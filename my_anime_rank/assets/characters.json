She detests the World Government, but wants to keep her Shichibukai title. Her immense beauty belies her cruel personality, as shown when she kicks a kitten in her way.\n\nAs children, Hancock and her sisters were captured and sold as slaves for the World Nobles. There she was branded with 'Dragon Foot' - a sign that proves your misery and status as a slave. To hide this fact, she has spread a rumor among her people that upon battling a Gorgon, she and her sisters were cursed, and now have Gorgon eyes on their backs that will turn anyone around into stone if it is exposed.\n\nShe has an immense crush on Luffy, so much so that if she stays away from him, she is stricken with 'Love Sickness' and will eventually die.\n\nShe ate 'mero-mero' fruit when she was a slave and gained the ability to turn anyone who thinks she is beautiful into stone. She is also one of the few characters who possesses 'Haoshoku Haki (or King's Disposition/Will)'. The others being Rayleigh, Whitebeard, Luffy and Shanks.",
